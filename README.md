#### As every surfer will probably know preperation of your surf session is very important.

#### Also the surfer can save sessions and see them in an organized overview.

## Functionalities

#### [-] Personal account (log in with google services).
#### [-] Overview of saved surf spots and surf sessions, stored on the web.
#### [-] Search function by city name (surf spot name).
#### [-] Overview of a surfspot with current wheather conditions.
#### [-] Possability to chose a date and save a session.

## Room for improvement

#### Ofcourse it would be a big improvement to retrieve weather for the data a session is planned on,
#### however this was hard to combine with (the free version of) the weather API.

#### Also it would be great to make it a more social platform where surfers can share their sessions
#### and plan sessions together.
